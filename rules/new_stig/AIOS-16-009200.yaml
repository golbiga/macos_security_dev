title: Apple iOS/iPadOS 16 must be configured to not allow backup of [all applications, configuration data] to locally connected systems.
discussion: |-
  Data on mobile devices is protected by numerous mechanisms, including user authentication, access control, and cryptography. When the data is backed up to an external system (either locally connected or cloud based), many if not all of these mechanisms are no longer present. This leaves the backed-up data vulnerable to attack. Disabling backup to external systems mitigates this risk.
