title: Apple iOS/iPadOS 16 must not allow non-DoD applications to access DoD data.
discussion: |-
  App data sharing gives apps the ability to access the data of other apps for enhanced user functionality. However, sharing also poses a significant risk that unauthorized users or apps will obtain access to sensitive DoD information. To mitigate this risk, there are data sharing restrictions. If a user is allowed to make exceptions to the data sharing restriction policy, the user could enable unauthorized sharing of data, leaving it vulnerable to breach. Limiting the granting of exceptions to either the Administrator or common application developer mitigates this risk.

  Copy/paste of data between applications in different application processes or groups of application processes is considered an exception to the access control policy; therefore, the Administrator must be able to enable/disable the feature. Other exceptions include allowing any data or application sharing between process groups.
