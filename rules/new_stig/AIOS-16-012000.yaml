title: A managed photo app must be used to take and store work-related photos.
discussion: |-
  The iOS Photos app is unmanaged and may sync photos with a device user's personal iCloud account. Therefore, work-related photos must not be taken via the iOS camera app or stored in the Photos app. A managed photo app must be used to take and manage work-related photos.
