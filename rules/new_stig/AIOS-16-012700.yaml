title: Apple iOS/iPadOS 16 must disable Password AutoFill in browsers and applications.
discussion: |-
  The AutoFill functionality in browsers and applications allows the user to complete a form that contains sensitive information, such as PII, without previous knowledge of the information. By allowing the use of the AutoFill functionality, an adversary who learns a user's iPhone and iPad passcode, or who otherwise is able to unlock the device, may be able to further breach other systems by relying on the AutoFill feature to provide information unknown to the adversary. By disabling the AutoFill functionality, the risk of an adversary gaining further information about the device's user or compromising other systems is significantly mitigated.
