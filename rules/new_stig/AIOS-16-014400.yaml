title: Apple iOS/iPadOS 16 must disable connections to Siri servers for the purpose of dictation.
discussion: |-
  If a user is able to configure the security setting, the user could inadvertently or maliciously set it to a value that poses unacceptable risk to DoD information systems. An adversary could exploit vulnerabilities created by the weaker configuration to compromise DoD sensitive information. Dictation information could contain sensitive DoD information and therefore should not leave the DoD control.
